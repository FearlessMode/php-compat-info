We distribute a http://www.php.net/phar[PHP Archive] (PHAR) that contains
all required dependencies of PHP [label label-primary]#CompatInfo# bundled in a single file.

link:{pharstable}["Download the latest version",role="primary",icon="glyphicon-download-alt",options="block,white"]
endif::[]
ifndef::basebackend-bootstrap[]
link:{pharstable}[Download the latest version]
endif::[]

Make it executable, and put it into your `$PATH`.
----
$ chmod +x phpcompatinfo.phar
$ mv phpcompatinfo.phar /usr/local/bin/phpcompatinfo

$ phpcompatinfo --version
----

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it.
----
$ wget http://bartlett.laurent-laville.org/get/phpcompatinfo.phar
$ php phpcompatinfo.phar --version
----

With both methods then you have this output :

[TIP]
====
Like [label label-primary]#CompatInfo# always needs a JSON file to run, Remi Collet
https://github.com/llaville/php-compat-info/issues/120#issuecomment-46188900[shared]
a workaround solution exposed here that allows to run :
----
$ phpcompatinfo analyser:run .
----
====

plugins::
this entry list all plugins added to the core base code of PHP Reflect.
+
CAUTION: Don't forget to add at least this default content, else the `analyser:run`
and `analyser:list` commands wouldn't be available.

analysers::
this entry list all analysers that may be used with the `analyser:run` command.
+
IMPORTANT: Don't miss it, else you could not run the `analyser:run` command.
