The next stable version 3.2 of [label label-primary]#CompatInfo# is on way.
We have reached today the last milestone, to enhance stability and fixed regression issues.

There are also some false-positive fixed from the 2.26  

If you want to test the current test version, you can either :

* clone the GitHub repository at least since commit 94643
* download the PHAR version at http://bartlett.laurent-laville.org/get/phpcompatinfo-3.1.0-88-g9464394.phar

Stable Release 3.2.0 is planned next week with a full Migration Guide (still missing from 
http://php5.laurent-laville.org/compatinfo/manual/3.2/en/getting-started.html[documentation])

Feedback are welcome !
