****
The next stable version 3.2 of [label label-primary]#CompatInfo# is now finished to be release as stable.

We will wait final version of PHP 5.5.15 and PHP 5.4.31 before to publish it.
****

It's the moment to explain new major improvement in class method detection that was fixed today :
See https://github.com/llaville/php-compat-info/issues/100[GH-100] report.

[WARNING]
==========
To solve the GH-100 issue, [label label-primary]#CompatInfo# 3.2 will need the new Reflect 2.2 API.
