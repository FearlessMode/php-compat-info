When I've begun to release the new major version 3.x, I hoped to follow PHP 5 releases as I did in past
with versions 2.x

With lack of feedback during Release Candidates phases (more than 2 months), I've let passed a major regression
since latest version 2.26

Even, if I've found origine of issue, I'll take my time now to prepare a new STABLE version with
a full documentation (user and developer).

Until it come, there won't be new versions published.

Only news will be published on this blog during transition from 3.1 to 3.2 and on the github project page.
