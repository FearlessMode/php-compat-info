Reason of silence since last stable version, one month ago.

If you follow my work, you're probably surprised to see no new version since latest stable release 2.26.0

I've decided to focus my attention / energy, on the new major version 3.0.0 : 
a full rewrite, that will take advantage of PHP 5.3 features. 

After Reflect (the PHP parser) rewrites, and the first release candidate published one month ago,
I've reached a milestone that is closed to a fisrt Release Candidate for CompatInfo.

Before the launch of this first release candidate, I'll introduce in next days the changes
of this new major version 3.0, on this blog.
